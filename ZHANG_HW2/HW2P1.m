% Translate the following mathematical expressions into MATLAB
% expressions. The output of each expression should be assigned to the variable output.
% Assume all symbolic variables represent vectors with dimensions of 1 x n where n is some
% integer greater than 1. Only include array operations where absolutely necessary. For example,
% pv would be translated to output = p.*v. 

% In general, the '.' is used as an element-wise vector operation.

% i) output = p+w./u
% ii) output = u.*exp(p)
% iii) output = 1-1./cos(x)
% iv) output = (p+w./(u+v))./(p+w./(u-v))
% v) output = x.^(1/2)
% vi) output = y.^(y+z)
% vii) output = x.^(y.^z)
% viii) output = x-(x.^3./factorial(3))+(x.^5./factorial(5))
