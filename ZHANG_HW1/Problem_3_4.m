%% Problem 4
% (i) x = 2, 15 is not a valid MATLAB expression because it assigns the
% value 2 to x and 15 to ans.
% (ii) x = 3.57*e2 is not valid because the variable 'e2' is undefined.
% (iv) x = 3.57e2.1 is not valid because of the second period in 2.1, which
% is not recognized in MATLAB.
% (viii) x = 3,57e-2 is not valid because it assigns the value 3 to x and
% 0.5700 to ans.
% (ix) x = (1 5 7) is not valid because it is not the correct way of
% defining a vector in MATLAB.
